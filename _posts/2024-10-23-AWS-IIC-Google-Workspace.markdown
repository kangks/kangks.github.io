### Overview of Centralized Identity Store Integration

**The Importance of Centralized Identity Management**

In todayâ€™s distributed environments, managing identities across platforms is complex and risky. A centralized identity store simplifies user access, reduces administrative burden, and enhances security. It serves as a single source of truth, ensuring that user roles and access are managed from one system. When employees leave, centralized identity management ensures that access is revoked across all systems, minimizing the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access.

**Use Case: Mitigating Offboarding Risks**

Without a centralized system, offboarding employees becomes a security liability as access may remain active across multiple platforms. By using a centralized identity store, access can be revoked instantly across all services, reducing the risk of security breaches.

**AWS IAM Identity Center**

AWS IAM Identity Center provides a default identity directory for managing AWS access, but many organizations use external providers like Google Workspace, Okta, or Microsoft Azure AD. IAM Identity Center supports these [integrations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/tutorials.html), enabling organizations to centralize identity management while providing seamless Single Sign-On (SSO) for AWS resources. Through this integration, administrators can automate user provisioning using SCIM and manage access in one place, enhancing security and efficiency.

## Step-by-Step

_Tips: Having two windows side by side, windows #1 on Google Workspace, windows #2 on the AWS IAM Identity Center, will be helpful in this step-by-step guides._

> This step-by-step guide augmented with screenshots and grouping by AWS Console and Google Admin for better clarity. The original documentation on AWS can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/gs-gwp.html).

![Side-by-Side](/assets/images/2024-10-23-AWS-IIC-Google-Workspace/Google_Admin_-_AWS_-_side-by-side.png)

### Step 1: Google Workspace: Configure the SAML application

1. Go to https://admin.google.com, and login using an account with super administrator privileges.

2. In the left navigation panel of your Google Admin console, choose Apps and then choose Web and Mobile Apps. ![Google Admin > Web and Mobile Apps](/assets/images/2024-10-23-AWS-IIC-Google-Workspace/Google-admin-apps-mobile.png)

3. In the Add app dropdown list, select Search for apps.
![Google Admin > Web and Mobile Apps > Search for apps](/assets/images/2024-10-23-AWS-IIC-Google-Workspace/Google_admin_search_for_apps.png)


4. In the search box enter Amazon Web Services, then select Amazon Web Services (SAML) app from the list.
![Google Admin > Web and Mobile Apps > Search for apps > amazon web](/assets/images/2024-10-23-AWS-IIC-Google-Workspace/Google_Admin_Amazon_Web.png)

Keep this page of Google admin open, and open another windows for AWS IAM Identity Center. We will need to copy metadata and parameteres between the two providers.

### Step 2: Change and setup Google Workspace as an SAML identity provider

1. Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/home and sign in to the IAM Identity Center console using a role with administrative permissions.

2. Choose Settings in the left navigation pane.

3. On the Settings page, choose Actions, and then choose Change identity source. ![AWS IAM Identity Console > Change Identity Source](/assets/images/2024-10-23-AWS-IIC-Google-Workspace/AWS_IIC_Change_Identity_source.png)

3. On the Choose identity source page, select External identity provider, and then choose Next. ![AWS IAM Identity Console > Change Identity Source > External identity provider](/assets/images/2024-10-23-AWS-IIC-Google-Workspace/AWS_IIC_Change_Identity_Source_to_External_IdentityProvider.png)

#### AWS Console: Configure the IdP SAML in AWS IAM Identity Center
5. We need to copy the following, from Google Admin to Amazon Web Services:
   1.  On the Google Identity Provider details - Amazon Web Services page:
       1. Download IdP metadata.
       2. Copy the SSO URL, Entity ID URL, and Certificate information.
   6. On the AWS IAM Identity Center
       1. Upload the IdP metadata to IdP SAML metadata
       2. Paste the values to IdP sign-on URL, IdP issuer URL, and IdP certificate.
