## Repository Insights: Amazon Bedrock and Anthropic Claudes
The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kangks/amazon-bedrock-computer-use) showcases a practical implementation of Anthropic Claudes through Amazon Bedrock:

### High-Level Architecture
- **LLM Core:** Amazon Bedrock powers Anthropic Claude model , enabling robust natural language processing.
- **Task Orchestration:** The `main.py` script coordinates user queries and task execution.
- **Modules:**
  - `computer_use.py` for local system operations (e.g., capturing screenshots).
  - `s3_upload.py` for cloud data storage tasks.

### Workflow in `main.py`
1. **User Input Processing:** Natural language inputs are sent to Anthropic Claudes via Amazon Bedrock.
2. **Response Parsing:** The LLMâ€™s output is parsed to determine appropriate actions.
3. **Action Execution:**
   - Local tasks are handled by `computer_use.py`.
   - Cloud tasks are executed by `s3_upload.py`.
4. **Feedback Loop:** Results are logged and refined through additional interactions with the LLM.

### Real-World Scenarios
- **Travel Planning:** Automatically logs airfare options for specified routes.
- **Content Retrieval:** Retrieves and organizes articles based on user-defined queries.
